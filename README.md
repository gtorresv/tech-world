## Installation

For the project if you do not have node installed in your computer you can follow the [node.js install](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) link to view how to install it. Once you have the application downloaded to your computer, you can open it with Visual Studio Code and on the repository's terminal you would need to run an `npm install` command. In order to use the backend to the e-commerce you would also need to have [MySQL](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) installed. To test the routes you can install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download).

## Usage

This application can be used by downloading the app and opening it through Visual Studio Code. You can open up terminal within the directory and run `npm install`. Also, make sure you have your mysql username, password and database name stored in the dotenv file before you start the server. You would also need to sign in to your mysql account through the terminal and source the schema database and afterwards exit. Finally, you can do an `npm run start` to start the server. On Insomnia you can GET the e-commerce data, CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE it. 

The following video is a demonstration of how to use the application.
